# Baselode Viewer

Desktop drilling-data viewer by **Darkmine**, built as a React/Vite app wrapped
in [Tauri v2](https://v2.tauri.app/) for distribution as a native Windows `.exe`
(and macOS / Linux binaries). The UI is a lightweight wrapper around the
[`baselode`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/baselode) library — open a project
folder of CSVs and explore the holes on a map, in 3D, and as strip logs.

## Features

- **Map** — collars plotted on OpenStreetMap with clustering, hole search, and
  a per-hole quick-look chart.
- **3D Scene** — desurveyed drillhole traces with optional structural discs,
  geology-categorical and assay-numeric colouring, and depth strip logs.
- **Strip Log** — 1×4 grid of independent depth plots (Plotly), one per
  selected hole/property.

The Drillhole Block Model and Polygon Grade Blocks viewers from the upstream
demo are intentionally **out of scope** for this app.

## Expected project folder structure

Pick a folder from the sidebar's **Open project folder** button. The folder
should contain one or more of the canonical files below — each can be **either
`.parquet` or `.csv`**, named exactly (lowercase):

```
my-project/
├── collars.{parquet,csv}                  (required)
├── survey.{parquet,csv}                   (recommended — needed for 3D)
├── assays.{parquet,csv}                   (optional — drives the colour-by menu)
├── geology.{parquet,csv}                  (optional — categorical colour-by)
├── structure.{parquet,csv}                (optional — structural discs in 3D)
└── precomputed_desurveyed.{parquet,csv}   (optional — bypasses live desurvey)
```

Only `collars` is required. If both formats are present for a file the
**Parquet copy wins** (smaller, faster to parse). Missing files are skipped
silently and the affected viewer falls back to a placeholder.

### Canonical schema

Column names match `baselode`'s `standardizeColumns` aliases verbatim — the
loader does no remapping. Synonyms (e.g. `lat` for `latitude`, `md` for
`depth`) are accepted because baselode standardises on read.

| File          | Required columns | Common optional columns |
|---------------|------------------|-------------------------|
| `collars`     | `hole_id`, `latitude`, `longitude` | `elevation`, `datasource_hole_id`, `project_id`, `hole_type`, `max_depth` |
| `survey`      | `hole_id`, `depth`, `azimuth`, `dip` | — |
| `assays`      | `hole_id`, `from`, `to` | one or more analyte columns (e.g. `Au_PPM`, `Cu_PCT`) |
| `geology`     | `hole_id`, `from`, `to` | `geology_code`, `geology_description`, plus any other intervaled attributes |
| `structure`   | `hole_id`, `depth`, `dip`, `azimuth` | `alpha`, `beta`, `strike` |
| `precomputed_desurveyed` | `hole_id`, `x`, `y`, `z`, `md` | — (already-projected, scene-frame XYZ) |

`hole_id` is the join key across files — use the same string everywhere.

The viewer projects collar lat/lng to a **local tangent plane** centred on the
collar centroid (meters east/north). For projects spanning <100 km this is
visually indistinguishable from a per-zone UTM; for continental-scale data,
supply a `precomputed_desurveyed` file produced with your own projection.

## Bundled test data

A converted copy of the GSWA Geochemistry sample (CC BY 4.0, see
`test-data/demo-gswa/ATTRIBUTION.md`) lives at:

```
test-data/demo-gswa/
├── collars.{csv,parquet}    4,685 holes
├── survey.{csv,parquet}     158k rows
├── assays.{csv,parquet}     69k rows × 53 analytes
└── geology.{csv,parquet}    5,831 rows
```

Open that folder from the sidebar to load it.

**CSV is a 10-row sample, Parquet is the full dataset.** The loader picks
Parquet first when both are present, so runtime tests see the complete data;
the CSVs are kept around purely so a human can open one in an editor and
sight-check the schema + a few representative rows. The conversion script
preserves this asymmetry on regenerate. To regenerate from a fresh
upstream pull:

```sh
python3 scripts/convert_demo_data.py \
    ../baselode/test/data/gswa \
    ./test-data/demo-gswa
```

(`pip install pandas pyarrow` first.)

## Running

### Prerequisites

- **Node 18+** and **npm**
- **Rust** (for the Tauri backend) — install via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).
  On Windows you also need the
  [Microsoft C++ Build Tools](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/#windows).
- **WebView2** (Windows-only, pre-installed on Windows 11).

### Local web development (no Rust required)

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

Opens at <http://127.0.0.1:1420>. The folder picker falls back to a
`<input webkitdirectory>` element, so you can still test the data-load flow
without the desktop binary.

### Desktop development

```sh
npm install
npm run tauri:dev
```

Launches Vite, builds the Rust binary, and opens the Tauri window.

### Build a Windows installer

```sh
npm run tauri:build
```

Outputs `.msi` and `.exe` (NSIS) installers under
`src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`. Cross-building Windows artefacts from
macOS/Linux requires `cargo-xwin` and the Windows SDK; see the Tauri docs.

## Branding

App icons live in `src-tauri/icons/`. Drop a 1024×1024 source PNG and run
`npm run tauri icon path/to/source.png` to regenerate all platform variants.

## Releasing

Releases are tag-driven via `.github/workflows/release.yml`.

**Cut a new version** — either of these works:

```sh
# (a) From your machine, push a SemVer tag:
git tag v0.1.5
git push origin v0.1.5

# (b) From the GitHub UI, run the "release" workflow with a version input
# (e.g. 0.1.5) — the workflow tags the repo for you.
```

On either trigger the workflow:

1. Resolves the version, strips the leading `v`, and writes it into
   `package.json`, `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`, and `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`
   so all three stay in lock-step (Vite reads the JS version into
   `__APP_VERSION__`; Tauri reads the JSON version for the bundle).
2. Builds the matrix:
   - **macOS** — universal `.app` (aarch64 + x86_64)
   - **Windows** — `.msi` and NSIS `.exe`
   - **Linux** — `.deb` and `.AppImage`
3. Attaches every bundle to a **draft** GitHub Release named after the tag.
   Review the assets in the Releases UI and click **Publish** when ready.

Versioning convention: `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, starting at `v0.1.0`. The
workflow rejects non-SemVer strings.

For local one-off builds the version remains whatever's in `package.json` /
`tauri.conf.json` / `Cargo.toml` on disk — the workflow only edits them
in-runner, never commits the change back to the repo.
